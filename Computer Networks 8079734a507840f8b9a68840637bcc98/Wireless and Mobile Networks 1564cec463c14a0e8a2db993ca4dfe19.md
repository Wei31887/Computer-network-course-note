## Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)

---

- unique “code” assigned to each user; i.e., code set partitioning
    - all users share same frequency, but each user has own **chipping** **sequence** (i.e., code) to encode data
    - allows multiple users to “coexist” and transmit simultaneously with minimal interference (if codes are “orthogonal”)
- **Encoding**: inner product: (original data) X (chipping sequence)
- **Decoding**: summed inner-product: (encoded data) X (chipping sequence)
